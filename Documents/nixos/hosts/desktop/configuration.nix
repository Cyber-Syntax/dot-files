  ### Windows dualboot time date problem solve:
  #time.hardwareClockInLocalTime = true; # Didn't solve superProductivity date/time issue

  # This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
  # settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
  # on your system were taken. Itâ€˜s perfectly fine and recommended to leave
  # this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
  # Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
  # (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
  system.stateVersion = "24.11"; # Did you read the comment?
